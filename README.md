---

## 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**

Key steps completed in Python:

* Loaded and explored dataset with `df.info()` and `df.describe()`
* Imputed missing values in review ratings using category medians
* Standardized column names for readability
* Engineered new features like **age groups** and **purchase frequency**
* Dropped redundant variables after correlation checks
* Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL for SQL analysis

## 🧠 **Analysis Performed**

### **Using SQL**

Insights extracted from structured queries:

* Revenue comparison by gender
* High-spending customers using discounts
* Top 5 products based on ratings
* Average purchase amount by shipping type
* Subscriber vs. non-subscriber spending
* Most discount-dependent products
* Customer classification: **New, Returning, Loyal**
* Top 3 products per category
* Subscription likelihood among repeat buyers
* Revenue contribution by age groups 

---

## 📈 **Power BI Dashboard**

Built an interactive dashboard visualizing:

* Average purchase amount
* Average review rating
* Sales by category
* Revenue by age group
* Subscription status distribution
* Product category drill-downs
* Filters for gender, category, shipping, and subscription status 

---

## 🎯 **Key Insights**

* Clothing leads in revenue contribution
* Loyal customers dominate total purchases
* Young adults generate the highest revenue
* Express shipping users spend slightly more

## 🚀 **About the Project**

This project reflects my hands-on experience in solving real analytics problems using both technical and business lenses. I aimed to build a workflow that feels close to what analysts do in real industry environments—cleaning data, exploring patterns, validating through SQL, and presenting insights clearly through dashboards.

# 👤 **About Section (Human, Professional, Recruiter-Friendly)**

This project showcases my ability to take raw customer transaction data and turn it into meaningful insights that support decision-making. I combined Python, SQL, and Power BI to understand how different types of customers shop, what drives their spending, and which products contribute most to revenue.

I focused on building a clean, end-to-end pipeline—covering data cleaning, feature engineering, SQL-based business analysis, and a dashboard that presents insights in a simple and actionable way.
The goal was not just technical execution but also telling a clear story that can help a business improve retention, optimize marketing, and increase revenue.

This project reflects my approach as an analyst: **curious about patterns, careful with data, and committed to delivering insights that truly matter**.
